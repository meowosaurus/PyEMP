# PyEMP
PyEMP (Python EVE Mac Preview) is a simple and easy to use task manager for MacOS, which was greatly inspired by [EVE-O Preview](https://github.com/EveOPlus/eve-o-preview). 
The reason for this project is because EVE-O Preview only works on Windows (and with limited support for Linux)

This project does not change anything about EVE Online, it only focuses certain windows (EVE Online clients).

## TODO
- Add UI

## Setting up the development environment
1. Create a new python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the recently created virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install all requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the application `python main.py`
